What is Angular?
- Answer: Angular is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations. It aims to simplify the development and testing of single-page applications by providing a framework for client-side model-view-controller (MVC) and model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications.

What are the key features of Angular?
- Answer: 
  - Two-Way Data Binding: Angular facilitates the automatic synchronization between the model and the view.
  - Dependency Injection: It has a built-in dependency injection subsystem that helps the developer by making the application easier to develop, understand, and test.
  - Directives: Angular directives allow developers to invent new HTML syntax, specific to their application.
  - Routing: It has a rich set of functionalities to support complex routing, deep linking, and navigation.
  - Modular Development: Angular promotes modular development by organizing code into modules.

What are the advantages of using Angular?
- Answer: 
  - Simplified Development: Angular provides a robust framework that simplifies the client-side scripting.
  - Testability: It comes with a complete testing setup and is designed to be testable from the ground up.
  - Community Support: Being maintained by Google, it has a vast community of developers which makes it easier to find help and resources.
  - Reusability: Through Angularâ€™s modular development, developers can create reusable components.

What is Angular CLI?
- Answer: Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. It provides commands to create applications, components, directives, services, etc., along with build, testing and deployment capabilities.

What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?
- Answer: Angular is a complete rewrite of AngularJS by the same team that built AngularJS. Angular is a modern, component-based framework that offers better performance, more powerful templating, mobile support, and many other features, while AngularJS is the older framework based on MVC architecture.

How does Angular handle data-binding?
- Answer: Angular supports two-way data binding, a mechanism for coordinating the parts of a template and the underlying model. Changes in the domain model are automatically reflected in the view, and vice versa. This helps in reducing boilerplate code and potential errors.

What is RxJS in Angular?
- Answer: RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. Angular utilizes RxJS for handling asynchronous tasks and events effectively.

What is the role of NgModules in Angular?
- Answer: NgModules are a core concept in Angular, which helps in organizing an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. It is a container for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities.

How can you deploy an Angular application?
- Answer: Angular applications can be deployed in various ways:
  -- Static File Hosting: Angular applications consist of static files that can be hosted on any web server, including providers like AWS S3, Firebase Hosting, or a traditional web host.
  -- Server Rendering: Angular applications can be server-rendered to optimize the site for SEO and improve initial load performance.
  -- Containerization: Angular applications can also be containerized using technologies like Docker and deployed to container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

How does Angular support testing?
- Answer: Angular provides a robust set of testing utilities and supports popular testing frameworks like Jasmine and Karma. It supports both unit testing for testing individual components, directives, services, etc., and end-to-end (E2E) testing for testing the interaction between those parts as a complete application.
