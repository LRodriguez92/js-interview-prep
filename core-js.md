What is JavaScript? Explain its key features.
- JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily known for enhancing interactivity and dynamic content in web browsers. Key features of JavaScript include:
  - Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is loosely typed, allowing variable types to be determined at runtime.
  - Event-Driven: Supports event-driven programming, enabling interactive user interfaces.
  - Object-Oriented: Supports object-oriented programming with objects and prototypes.
  - Functional Programming: Supports functional programming paradigms with first-class functions and closures.
  - Platform-Independent: Runs in any modern web browser on any operating system.

What are the differences between ES6 and earlier versions?
- ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several notable features compared to earlier versions, including:
  - Arrow Functions: Concise syntax for writing function expressions.
  - Promises: A native way to handle asynchronous operations.
  - let and const: Block-scoped variable and constant declarations.
  - Template Literals: Enhanced syntax for string manipulation.
  - Classes: Syntactic sugar for prototype-based inheritance.

What is the JavaScript Engine?
- The JavaScript Engine is a virtual machine that interprets and executes JavaScript code in a host environment, typically a web browser. Key components include the memory heap, call stack, and a just-in-time (JIT) compiler.

Explain the difference between Node.js, browser environment, and JavaScript.
- Node.js: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run server-side, providing access to system resources and additional libraries.
- Browser Environment: The client-side runtime environment where JavaScript is traditionally executed to manipulate web pages and handle user interactions.
- JavaScript: The programming language that can be executed in both the browser environment and Node.js.

What are the main principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript?
- The main principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript include:
  -- Encapsulation: Grouping data and functions together to create objects.
  -- Inheritance: Creating new objects based on existing objects to promote code reuse.
  -- Polymorphism: Treating objects as instances of their parent class, leading to simpler code and fewer errors.

Explain the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in JavaScript.
- Encapsulation: Encapsulation is achieved by creating objects using constructor functions or classes, and using closures to create private state.
- Inheritance: Inheritance in JavaScript is prototype-based, where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.
- Polymorphism: Polymorphism is achieved through prototype inheritance, allowing methods defined on an object's prototype to be called on objects that inherit from that prototype.

What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript?
- Undefined indicates that a variable has been declared but not initialized, while null is an assignment value that represents no value or no object.

What is the difference between a function and an object in JavaScript?
- Functions are objects in JavaScript, but they have the special capability to be callable. Objects are instances of a prototype, which can have properties and methods but cannot be invoked like functions.

Explain the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
- Asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows the execution of code in a non-blocking manner. Promises, async/await, and callbacks are used to handle asynchronous tasks like network requests.

What are promises and callbacks? Why are they used?
- Promises and callbacks are constructs used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
  - Callbacks: Functions passed as arguments to other functions to be executed once an asynchronous operation completes.
  - Promises: Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, improving the readability and manageability of asynchronous code.

What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?
- In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the object that a function is a method of, or the context in which a function is called. Its value can change depending on how the function is invoked.

What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
- `==` is the equality operator that performs type coercion before comparing values, whereas `===` is the strict equality operator that compares both value and type without performing type coercion.

What are the different types of scopes in JavaScript?
- Global Scope: Variables are accessible from anywhere in the code.
- Function Scope: Variables are accessible within the function they were declared.
- Block Scope: Variables are accessible within the block they were declared (using let or const).

What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?
- `var` is function-scoped and hoisted to the top of its scope, `let` is block-scoped and not hoisted, and `const` is block-scoped and not hoisted, with an additional constraint of being read-only.
